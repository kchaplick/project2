### Project 2 - Dog Adoption Application

## This application produces a survey in which a user answers questions that determine a selection of dog breeds applicable to their personality.
## Then, the user is brought to a page that utilizes the PetFinder API to display adoptable dogs of specific breeds from a specified distance of a certain zipcode.

## The different utilities involved include Node and Express web servers, information backed by a Sequelize database with MySQL accessed with GET and POST routes.

## It has been deployed to Heroku: https://penn-project2.herokuapp.com/.
